# Cybersecurity-Monitoring-Strategy-Using-PRTG

##  Project Overview

This project simulates the development and implementation of a proactive cybersecurity monitoring strategy for a fictional organization, **Big Dog Enterprise**. The core objective is to secure business-critical assets by aligning monitoring tools with organizational risk levels and established industry frameworks like **NIST CSF**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **CIS Controls**.

## Executive Summary

Big Dog Enterprise operates a hybrid infrastructure, including Windows servers, Linux development machines, and Windows workstations. To reduce the risk of security breaches, the project leverages **PRTG Network Monitor** for real-time threat detection, response automation, and actionable insights into system vulnerabilities. All efforts focus on protecting data confidentiality, system integrity, and service availability.

## Objectives

- Prioritize security sensors based on the importance of the assets they monitor, threat landscape, and risk severity.
- Establish alert thresholds for timely incident detection and response.
- Recommend monitoring strategies tied to organizational priorities and compliance requirements.


##  Methodology

The project followed a structured four-phase methodology, aligned with NIST RMF stages:

1. **Prepare (Asset Identification)**  
   Assets were categorized under five Security Impact Levels (SILs) ‚Äì Privacy, Proprietary, Administrative, Financial, and Security Management.

2. **Identify (Risk and Threat Analysis)**  
   Used the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify techniques and tactics targeting critical systems.

3. **Detect (Sensor Deployment & Threshold Configuration)**  
   Configured and deployed PRTG sensors across key endpoints, databases, and network devices.

4. **Respond (Incident Handling Protocols)**  
   Mapped custom alert thresholds and escalation playbooks to support rapid mitigation.

##  Security Impact Levels (SILs)

1. **Privacy** ‚Äì Protects customer/employee data on Windows workstations.  
2. **Proprietary** ‚Äì Safeguards intellectual property on Linux dev environments.  
3. **Administrative** ‚Äì Ensures SQL server/database reliability and monitoring.  
4. **Financial** ‚Äì Secures accounting applications and transaction records.  
5. **Security Management** ‚Äì Monitors PRTG and centralized logging systems.
